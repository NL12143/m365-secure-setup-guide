Enrich your HTML pages with icons—especially emoji-style ones like 📱 or 🧩 
Unicode characters that browsers render as glyphs. 

Here's how it works and where to find a full overview:

🧠 How Emoji Icons Work in HTML
Emojis are Unicode characters, not images.
They render as styled glyphs using system fonts (like Segoe UI Emoji or Apple Color Emoji).
You can insert them directly (e.g. 📱) or use Unicode escape codes:
Decimal: &#128241; → 📱
Hex: &#x1F4F1; → 📱
They behave like text—meaning you can style them with CSS, resize them, or wrap them in links just like any other character.

📚 Where to Browse Emoji Icons
Here are the best resources for exploring emoji codes and usage:

Resource	    Description
W3Schools     Emoji Reference	Simple overview with examples and Unicode values
GeeksforGeeks Emoji Guide	Explains decimal and hex usage with categories
SitePoint     Emoji Tutorial	Deep dive into styling, accessibility, and Unicode mapping
Unicode       Emoji Charts	Official source for all emoji code points and categories

🛠️ Example Usage in Your HTML
<li>&#128241; <a href="SPFx-Setup.html">SPFx-Setup Guide</a></li>
<li>🔍<a href="yo-wpa-vue-audit-report.html">yo-wpa-vue-audit-report</a></li>
Both lines render the same icon—one using direct character, the other using Unicode escape.

🔧 Bonus Tip: Emoji Shortcodes
On GitHub-flavored Markdown, you can also use emoji shortcodes like :package: or :lock::
- :package: Package hygiene
- :lock: Compliance checklist
They render as 📦 and 🔒 respectively.


🧠 Windows Emoji Picker 
Is a built-in Windows feature that lets you insert:
Emoji characters (like 📱, 🧩, 🔐)
Kaomoji (like (●'◡'●) or ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
Symbols (arrows, currency, math, etc.)
These are all Unicode characters, meaning they’re part of the universal character set supported by most modern apps, browsers, and Markdown renderers.
It is triggered by Windows key + ; (or Windows key + .), and is called the Windows Emoji Picker, and it’s deeply tied to Unicode.
