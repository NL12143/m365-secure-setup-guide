🧠 Two Complementary Structures
Structure Type	Focus	Best For
By Service	Outlook, Teams, SharePoint	App-specific configuration
By Governance Aspect	Visibility, Access, Retention	Cross-service policies and risks
Your new section is the beginning of a governance-focused layer—which could evolve into a second part of the guide. You could expand it with aspects like:

🔍 Discovery & Indexing: Search indexing, Restricted Content Discovery, Graph grounding

🔐 Access Control: Guest access, Conditional Access, PIM

🗃️ Retention & Lifecycle: Retention policies, auto-expanding archives, deletion schedules

🧠 Copilot Exposure: What content Copilot can reason over, and how to limit it

Would you like help drafting a second section header like “Governance Aspects & Cross-Service Controls” to house these kinds of entries? It would keep your guide clean while adding depth.
